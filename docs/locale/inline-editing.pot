msgid "Mezzanine comes with the ability for content authors to edit content directly within a page while viewing it on the website, rather than having to log into the admin area. Content authors can simply log into the admin area as usual, but by selecting *Site* on the login screen the author will then be redirected back to the website where a small *Edit* icon will be found next to each piece of editable content, such as a page's title or a blog post's body. Clicking on the Edit icon will allow the author to update the individual piece of content without leaving the page."

msgid "Making content in-line editable is as simple as wrapping model fields with a template tag in your templates. The default templates installed with Mezzanine all have their content configured to be in-line editable. When developing your own templates from scratch though, you'll need to perform this step yourself."

msgid "The second step is to wrap each instance of a model field with the ``editable`` and ``endeditable`` template tags, with the field specified as the ``editable`` tag's argument. The content between the two tags is what will visibly be hinted to the content author as being editable. It's possible to not provide any content between the two tags, in which case the value for the model field specified for the ``editable`` tag will simply be used. The model field must always be specified in the format ``instance_name.field_name`` where ``instance_name`` is the name of a model instance in the template context. For example, suppose we had a ``page`` variable in our template with ``title`` and ``content`` fields::"

msgid "The ``editable`` template tag also allows multiple fields for a model instance to be given as arguments to a single ``editable`` tag. The result of this is still a single Edit icon, but when clicked will display each of the fields specified for editing, grouped together in a single form. Continuing on from the previous example, if we wanted to group together the ``title`` and ``content`` fields::"
