msgid "Mezzanine provides the ability for public users to create their own accounts for logging into your Mezzanine powered site. Features that can be restricted to logged-in users include the ability to post comments, make purchases (using `Cartridge <http://cartridge.jupo.org>`_), view restricted pages, and anything else you'd like to implement. You can also define what a user's profile consists of, allowing users to create their own profile page for their account."

However you may want to store extra fields in user profiles, but not expose these fields to the user. You may also want to have no profile model at all, and strip the signup and update profile forms down to only the minimum required fields on the user model, such as username and password."

Suppose we define a ``DateTimeField`` on the profile model called ``signup_date`` which we don't want exposed. We also might not bother asking the user for their first and last name, which are fields defined by Django's user model. In our ``settings.py`` module we would define::"

A list of email addresses can be configured in the admin settings interface, which will then be notified by email each time a new account is created and requires activation. Users are then sent a notification when their accounts are activated by a staff member."
