If you're new to Django, you'll need to work through the `Django tutorial <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/>`_ before being able to understand the concepts used throughout the Mezzanine documentation. *A mantra for working with Mezzanine: Mezzanine Is Just Django* - `Ken Bolton <http://bscientific.org/>`_, long-time Mezzanine contributor."
