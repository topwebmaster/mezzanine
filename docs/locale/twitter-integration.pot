msgid "As of June 2013, Twitter also requires that all API access is authenticated. For this you'll need to configure a Twitter application with OAuth credentials for your site to access the Twitter API. These credentials are configurable as Mezzanine settings. See the :doc:`configuration` section for more information on these, as well as the `Twitter developer site <https://dev.twitter.com/>`_ for info on creating an application and configuring your OAuth credentials."

To consume Twitter feeds, only read permissions are needed, but you may also choose to allow both read and write permissions. With write permissions enabled, you'll then also be able to expose the option in Mezzanine's admin interface for automatically tweeting new blog posts (or your own custom content) when they're published."
